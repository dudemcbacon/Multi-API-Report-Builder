# Git History Cleanup Report

**Date:** 2025-10-01
**Tool Used:** git-filter-repo v2.47.0
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - History fully sanitized

---

## Overview

Comprehensive git history rewrite performed to remove all traces of:
- Hardcoded API credentials
- Company identifiers ("Fourlane")
- Identifying file paths (usernames, OneDrive paths)
- Any other sensitive information

---

## Backup Information

**Backup Location:** `../multi-api-backup.bundle`
**Backup Size:** 465 KB
**Backup Type:** Git bundle (complete repository with all history)

### To Restore from Backup (if needed)
```bash
cd "../"
git clone multi-api-backup.bundle restored-repo
```

---

## History Rewrite Details

### Tool Installation
```bash
pip install git-filter-repo
```

### Replacements Applied

#### 1. Company Name Sanitization
- `Fourlane` → `CompanyName`
- `fourlane` → `company`
- `FOURLANE` → `COMPANYNAME`
- `shop.fourlane.com` → `shop.example.com`
- `fourlane.my.salesforce.com` → `company.my.salesforce.com`

#### 2. File Path Sanitization
- `/mnt/c/Users/QuinnQuigley/OneDrive - Fourlane/Desktop/Projects/SalesForceReportPull/` → (removed)
- `C:\\Users\\Quinn\\OneDrive - Fourlane\\Desktop\\Projects\\Operations\\` → (removed)
- `/Users/Quinn/OneDrive - Fourlane/Desktop/Projects/` → (removed)
- `//c/Users/Quinn/OneDrive - Fourlane/Desktop/Projects/` → (removed)
- `OneDrive - Fourlane` → `OneDrive`
- `QuinnQuigley` → `Developer`
- `/c/Users/Quinn/` → `~/`

#### 3. Credential Sanitization
- `ck_e2b4caeb891d25870a90e7d9aeb3007d90657492` → `ck_EXAMPLE1234567890abcdefghijklmnop`
- `cs_d878c9659092943277d9349edfac19169a1efe53` → `cs_EXAMPLE0987654321zyxwvutsrqponmlk`

## Execution Details

### Command Executed
```bash
python -m git_filter_repo --replace-text replace-expressions.txt --force
```

### Processing Stats
- **Commits Parsed:** 13
- **Processing Time:** 0.43 seconds
- **Repacking Time:** 50.09 seconds
- **Total Duration:** 50.52 seconds

### Side Effects
- **Origin remote removed** - This is normal behavior for git-filter-repo
  - Prevents accidental push of old history to remote
  - You'll need to re-add the remote before pushing

---

## Verification Results

### Tests Performed

#### 1. Search for "Fourlane" in History
```bash
git log --all --source --full-history -S "fourlane" -i --oneline
```
**Result:** ✅ No matches found

#### 2. Search for Hardcoded Credentials
```bash
git log --all --source --full-history -S "ck_e2b4caeb" --oneline
```
**Result:** ✅ No matches found

#### 3. Search for Identifying Username
```bash
git log --all --source --full-history -S "QuinnQuigley" --oneline
```
**Result:** ✅ No matches found

#### 4. Check Working Tree
```bash
grep -r "Fourlane" --include="*.py" --include="*.md" src/ docs/ README.md
grep -r "ck_e2b4caeb" --include="*.py" --include="*.md" .
```
**Result:** ✅ No matches found in either search

## Files Modified in History

The following file types were processed and sanitized:

- **Markdown files** (`.md`)
- **JSON files** (`.json`)
- **Text files** (`.txt`)
- **Configuration files** (`.env`, etc.)

---

## Post-Cleanup Actions Taken

### 1. Added New Files
- `.env.example` - Credential template
- `SECURITY_AUDIT_SUMMARY.md` - Security audit documentation
- `tests/README.md` - Test suite documentation
- Clean test files (QuickBase, Salesforce JWT tests)

### 2. Updated .gitignore
Added exclusions for:
- `.claude/` - Local Claude Code settings
- `PROJECT_PLAN.md` - Internal planning (contains old paths)
- `docs/SECURITY_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md` - Historical credential examples
- `tests/TEST_CLEANUP_REPORT.md` - Internal cleanup docs

### 3. Created Final Commit
Commit SHA: `8589174`
Message: "Add comprehensive security documentation and sanitized test suite"

---

## Remote Repository Setup

### Re-adding Remote (Required)

Since git-filter-repo removed the origin remote, you'll need to re-add it:

```bash
# Add the remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Multi-API-Report-Builder.git

# Verify remote was added
git remote -v
```

### Force Push Required

**CRITICAL:** You MUST force push since history was rewritten:

```bash
# Force push to replace remote history
git push origin main --force

# WARNING: This will overwrite the remote repository!
# Make sure you have a backup before doing this
```

### If Repository is Already Public

If you've already pushed the old history to GitHub:

1. **Consider these options:**
   - Delete and recreate the repository (cleanest)
   - Force push and notify all collaborators
   - Treat exposed credentials as compromised and rotate them

2. **Rotate any exposed credentials immediately:**
   - WooCommerce API keys
   - Salesforce credentials
   - Any other API keys that were in the old history

## Security Checklist - Pre-Push

Before pushing to GitHub, verify:

- [ ] Backup exists and is accessible: `../multi-api-backup.bundle`
- [ ] No "Fourlane" in history: `git log --all -S "fourlane" -i`
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in history: `git log --all -S "ck_e2b4c"`
- [ ] `.env` file is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] `*.key` files are in `.gitignore`
- [ ] `.env.example` uses placeholder values only
- [ ] Working tree is clean: `git status`
- [ ] Remote is set: `git remote -v`

---

## Files Protected by .gitignore

These files will NEVER be committed (verified):
- `.env` - Actual credentials
- `salesforce_private.key` - RSA private key
- `*.key`, `*.pem`, `*.p12`, `*.pfx` - All private keys
- `.claude/` - Local settings
- `PROJECT_PLAN.md` - Internal planning
- `docs/SECURITY_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md` - Historical examples
- `tests/TEST_CLEANUP_REPORT.md` - Internal docs

---

## Recovery Instructions

### If You Need to Undo This Cleanup

```bash
# 1. Navigate to parent directory
cd ..

# 2. Clone from backup bundle
git clone multi-api-backup.bundle restored-repo

# 3. Copy back to original location if needed
cd restored-repo
# Review and verify before proceeding
```

---

## Best Practices Going Forward

### 1. Before Each Commit
```bash
# Check what's being committed
git diff --staged

# Verify no sensitive files
git status

# Use git-secrets to prevent credential commits
git secrets --scan
```

### 2. Regular Audits
- Monthly: Scan for new credential leaks
- Quarterly: Full security audit
- Before major releases: Comprehensive review

### 3. Use Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Set up hooks
pre-commit install

# Configure to check for secrets
# Add to .pre-commit-config.yaml
```
