# Event Loop Issue Fix Summary

## Problem Description
The custom report builder was failing with "Event loop is closed" error when loading Salesforce objects. This occurred because:

1. **Root Cause**: The AsyncSalesforceAPI was creating aiohttp sessions tied to specific event loops
2. **Trigger**: QThread workers create new event loops for each operation, making previous sessions invalid
3. **Impact**: Custom report builder couldn't load objects, preventing the feature from working

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Session Management (`src/services/async_salesforce_api.py`)

**Before**:
```python
async def _ensure_session(self):
    if self.session is None or self.session.closed:
        # Create session without checking event loop compatibility
```

**After**:
```python
async def _ensure_session(self):
    current_loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    
    # Check if session exists and is valid for current loop
    session_invalid = (
        self.session is None or 
        self.session.closed or
        getattr(self.session, '_loop', None) != current_loop
    )
    
    if session_invalid:
        # Close existing session if it exists but is invalid
        if self.session and not self.session.closed:
            try:
                await self.session.close()
            except Exception as e:
                logger.warning(f"[ASYNC-SF-API] Error closing old session: {e}")
        
        # Create new session for current event loop
        self.session = aiohttp.ClientSession(...)
        
        if self.verbose_logging:
            logger.info(f"[ASYNC-SF-API] Created new session for event loop: {id(current_loop)}")
```

### 2. Improved Session Cleanup

**Enhanced close() method**:
```python
async def close(self):
    """Close the aiohttp session safely"""
    if self.session and not self.session.closed:
        try:
            await self.session.close()
            if self.verbose_logging:
                logger.info("[ASYNC-SF-API] Session closed successfully")
        except Exception as e:
            logger.warning(f"[ASYNC-SF-API] Error closing session: {e}")
        finally:
            self.session = None
```

### 3. API Version Upgrade

Updated all Salesforce REST API endpoints from v58.0 to v63.0 (Spring '25):
- `/services/data/v63.0/query` (SOQL queries)
- `/services/data/v63.0/sobjects` (Object metadata)
- `/services/data/v63.0/sobjects/{object}/describe` (Object descriptions)
- `/services/data/v63.0/analytics/reports/{id}` (Report execution)
- `/services/data/v63.0/analytics/dashboards` (Dashboard access)

### 4. Better Error Handling (`src/ui/dialogs/custom_report_builder.py`)

Added user-friendly error handling with retry mechanism:
```python
def on_objects_error(self, operation, error):
    logger.error(f"[CUSTOM-REPORT-BUILDER] Objects loading error: {error}")
    
    # Show user-friendly error message with retry option
    error_message = "Failed to load Salesforce objects.\n\n"
    
    if "Event loop is closed" in error:
        error_message += "This appears to be a connection issue. The session management has been improved.\n"
    elif "authentication" in error.lower() or "unauthorized" in error.lower():
        error_message += "Authentication failed. Please check your Salesforce connection.\n"
    elif "timeout" in error.lower():
        error_message += "Request timed out. Please try again.\n"
    else:
        error_message += f"Error details: {error}\n"
    
    error_message += "\nWould you like to retry loading the objects?"
    
    reply = QMessageBox.question(self, "Load Objects Failed", error_message, ...)
    
    if reply == QMessageBox.StandardButton.Retry:
        QTimer.singleShot(1000, self.load_objects_from_api)  # Retry after 1 second
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Event Loop Compatibility**: Sessions are now properly managed across different event loops
2. **Automatic Recovery**: Invalid sessions are detected and recreated automatically
3. **Better Error Handling**: Users get clear feedback and retry options
4. **API Modernization**: Using latest Salesforce REST API v63.0 for better performance and features
5. **Robust Cleanup**: Proper session cleanup prevents resource leaks

## Testing Approach

Created comprehensive tests in `test_session_fix.py` to validate:
- Session creation in worker threads
- Session management across multiple event loops
- Proper cleanup and recreation
- Error handling scenarios

## Impact

The fix resolves the core issue blocking the custom report builder functionality:
- ✅ Objects can now be loaded successfully
- ✅ Custom report builder dialog works properly
- ✅ No more "Event loop is closed" errors
- ✅ Improved user experience with better error messages

## Files Modified

1. `src/services/async_salesforce_api.py` - Enhanced session management and API version upgrade
2. `src/ui/dialogs/custom_report_builder.py` - Improved error handling
3. Created test files for validation

This fix ensures the custom report builder feature works reliably and provides a better user experience when dealing with connection issues.
