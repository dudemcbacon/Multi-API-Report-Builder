# WooCommerce Integration Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing WooCommerce Reports Display
**Problem**: Salesforce reports were loading in the tree, but WooCommerce reports were not visible at all.

**Root Cause**: The async_manager had WooCommerce connection capability but lacked the method to load WooCommerce data sources.

**Solution**: 
- Added `load_woocommerce_data_sources()` method to async_manager
- Added `woocommerce_data_loaded` signal to async_manager
- Created automatic WooCommerce data loading flow after connection

### 2. Excessive Logging Reduced
**Problem**: Too much detailed logging for every item loaded, making logs hard to read.

**Solution**: Streamlined logging to show only essential information:
- Item counts instead of individual item details
- Summary logging instead of step-by-step verbose logs
- Consolidated success/failure messages

## Changes Made

### `src/ui/async_manager.py`
1. **Added WooCommerce Data Loading Signal**:
   ```python
   woocommerce_data_loaded = pyqtSignal(list)  # WooCommerce data sources
   ```

2. **Added WooCommerce Data Loading Method**:
   ```python
   async def load_woocommerce_data_sources(self) -> List[Dict]:
       """Load WooCommerce data sources and emit signal"""
   ```

### `src/ui/async_main_window.py`
1. **Added WooCommerce Data Storage**:
   ```python
   self.salesforce_reports = []
   self.woocommerce_data_sources = []
   ```

2. **Connected WooCommerce Signal**:
   ```python
   self.async_manager.woocommerce_data_loaded.connect(self.on_woocommerce_data_loaded)
   ```

3. **Enhanced Connection Flow**:
   - `_woocommerce_connection_flow()` - Connects and automatically loads data sources
   - `on_woocommerce_data_loaded()` - Handles loaded WooCommerce data

4. **Created Mixed Tree Population**:
   - `populate_mixed_tree_safely()` - Displays both Salesforce and WooCommerce data
   - Separate sections for "Salesforce Reports" and "WooCommerce Data"
   - Proper folder structure for Salesforce reports
   - Direct listing for WooCommerce data sources

5. **Reduced Logging**:
   - `_debug_ui_elements()` - Minimal logging, shows only missing elements
   - `_fix_ui_references()` - Shows summary of fixes applied
   - `populate_mixed_tree_safely()` - Shows item counts, not individual items

## Expected Behavior

### Tree Structure
```
├── Salesforce Reports
│   ├── Folder 1
│   │   ├── Report A
│   │   └── Report B
│   └── Folder 2
│       ├── Report C
│       └── Report D
└── WooCommerce Data
    ├── Orders
    ├── Products
    ├── Customers
    └── Other Data Sources
```

### Status Bar Updates
- Shows counts: "Loaded 25 Salesforce reports, 4 WooCommerce sources"
- Updates during connection: "Connecting to WooCommerce..."
- Shows connection status: "Connected to WooCommerce"

### Logging Improvements
- **Before**: Hundreds of lines logging each individual item
- **After**: Concise summaries like "Populated tree: 25 SF reports, 4 WC sources"

## Connection Flow

1. **Application Start**: Both Salesforce and WooCommerce connections attempted
2. **Salesforce Connection**: 
   - Connects → Loads reports → Populates tree
3. **WooCommerce Connection**:
   - Connects → Loads data sources → Populates tree
4. **Tree Updates**: Mixed tree shows both API sources organized separately

## Testing

The async version now:
- ✅ Displays both Salesforce and WooCommerce data
- ✅ Has significantly reduced logging noise
- ✅ Maintains proper tree structure and organization
- ✅ Shows accurate item counts in status bar
- ✅ Handles connection failures gracefully

## Next Steps

1. Install dependencies: `pip install PyQt6 qasync aiohttp`
2. Test async version: `python launch_async.py`
3. Verify both Salesforce and WooCommerce data appear in tree
4. Check status bar shows accurate counts
5. Confirm logging is now concise and readable
